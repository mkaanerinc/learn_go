# Learn Go 🚀

Welcome to **Learn Go**, a personal project repository created as part of my journey into mastering the **Go programming language**. This project follows the [Go - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/go-the-complete-guide) course on Udemy and includes all exercises, demo projects, and hands-on implementations done throughout the course.

## 📚 About the Course

This repository is based on the **"Go - The Complete Guide"** Udemy course, which offers a comprehensive dive into Go — from beginner fundamentals to advanced concepts, including real-world project development.

### 📖 What the Course Covers:
- Go fundamentals: syntax, variables, types, control structures
- Data structures: arrays, slices, maps, and structs
- Functions, pointers, and error handling
- Interfaces and package management
- Concurrency with goroutines and channels
- Building RESTful APIs with authentication & SQL databases
- Code optimization techniques
- Hands-on demo projects to solidify learning

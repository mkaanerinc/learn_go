defer in Go
-----------
`defer` is a built-in keyword in Go that postpones the execution of a function or method
until the surrounding function (in which `defer` is declared) completes.

How it works:
-------------
- When a `defer` statement is encountered, Go schedules the deferred function to run **after the current function returns**.
- Deferred functions are executed in **LIFO (Last-In-First-Out)** order if there are multiple.

Common usage:
-------------
- Closing open files: `defer file.Close()`
- Unlocking mutexes: `defer mu.Unlock()`
- Recovering from panics: `defer recover()`

Benefits:
---------
- Ensures clean-up code is always run, even if an error occurs or a return happens early.
- Improves readability by placing cleanup near the resource allocation.
- Prevents resource leaks (open files, memory, network connections, etc.).

Code explanation:
-----------------
- `os.Open` tries to open a file. If it fails, an error is returned immediately.
- If the file is successfully opened, `defer file.Close()` ensures the file is closed **no matter what** happens afterward.
- `bufio.NewScanner` reads the file line by line.
- Each line is appended to a slice named `lines`.
- If a scanning error occurs, it's caught and reported.
- At the end, the lines are returned â€” and thanks to `defer`, the file is safely closed once the function ends.

Why `defer` here?
-----------------
If we didn't use `defer`, we would have to manually call `file.Close()` in every possible return path,
which is error-prone and harder to maintain.

Conclusion:
-----------
`defer` is ideal for resource cleanup. It simplifies code, avoids duplication, and guarantees execution.
